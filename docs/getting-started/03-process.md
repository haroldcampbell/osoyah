# 03 Process

Spec-first flow
- Review spec scope, DoD, and acceptance tests.
- Ask clarifying questions before coding.
- Implement minimal changes for one spec at a time.
- Update `docs/architecture.md` when data shapes change.

Testing
- User runs `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run e2e`.
- Logs live in `client/logs/`.

Decisions and hand-offs
- Update `docs/decisions.md` when choices change.
- Add a session hand-off entry per iteration.
