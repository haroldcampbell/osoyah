# Session Hand-Off

## How to Use

-   Add entries in `session-hand-offs/` named `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`.
    -   Summarize key decisions, progress, and next steps.
-   Add `yyyy-mm-dd-nn-title.md` to this file (use `nn` to preserve order for multiple entries in a day).
    -   Entries are added in reverse chronological order (Oldest at the bottom)
