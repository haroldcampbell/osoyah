## Summary
- Updated the Kanban board template to use Angular's built-in control flow syntax so lint passes.
- Tried to run Playwright setup and E2E tests; install timed out and E2E failed to start the web server.

## Work Completed
- Replaced `*ngIf`/`*ngFor` with `@if`/`@for` in the board template.
- Re-ran `npm run lint` successfully.
- Attempted `npx playwright install` (timed out in sandbox).
- Attempted `npm run e2e` (web server failed to bind to `127.0.0.1:4200`).

## Decisions
- None.

## Open Questions
- Does Playwright browser installation need to happen outside the sandboxed environment?
- Should the Playwright web server use a different port to avoid `EPERM` in this environment?

## Outstanding (M002)
- Install Playwright browsers and re-run `npm run e2e`. (Spec: `specs/M002-core-kanban/S005-testing.md`)

## Next Steps
- Install Playwright browsers in an environment with network access, then retry E2E.
- If `EPERM` persists, update Playwright webServer config to use an allowed port and retry.
