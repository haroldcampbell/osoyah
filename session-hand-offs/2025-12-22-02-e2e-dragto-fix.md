# 2025-12-22-02-e2e-dragto-fix

## Summary
- Reviewed test/lint/e2e logs and fixed failures tied to new component/service refactor.
- Refactored board components to use `BoardService` state directly and reduced inputs/outputs.
- Added shared SCSS tokens and moved Playwright artifacts into `client/logs`.

## Work Completed
- Introduced list/card components that consume `BoardService` and simplified templates.
- Added `client/src/styles/_tokens.scss` and refactored SCSS to use tokens.
- Stabilized E2E drag flow tests and updated tracking expressions.
- Moved Playwright report/output into `client/logs` via config updates.

## Decisions
- For Angular CDK drag-and-drop, prefer mouse-driven drags with small pauses.
- Prefer stable identifiers (e.g., `data-card-id`) for E2E assertions.
- Use `BoardService` as the shared state container for list/card components.
- Store Playwright artifacts under `client/logs`.

## Open Questions
- None.

## Outstanding (M002)
- Re-run `npm run test` and `npm run e2e` to confirm logs are clean after refactor.

## Next Steps
- Review `client/logs/*.log` after reruns and address remaining warnings.
