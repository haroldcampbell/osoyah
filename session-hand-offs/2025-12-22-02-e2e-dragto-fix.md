# 2025-12-22-02-e2e-dragto-fix

## Summary
- Reviewed `client/e2e.log`; failure was `page.dragAndDrop` called with locators.
- Updated E2E test to use more reliable drag flows for CDK interactions.
- Captured lessons about stable E2E selectors and drag strategy.

## Work Completed
- Reworked E2E drag interactions to use mouse-driven drags with small pauses.
- Updated E2E assertions to target stable ids instead of list counts or transient text.

## Decisions
- For Angular CDK drag-and-drop, prefer mouse-driven drags with small pauses.
- Prefer stable identifiers (e.g., `data-card-id`) for E2E assertions.

## Open Questions
- None.

## Outstanding (M002)
- Re-run `npm run e2e:log` to confirm E2E passes after drag/selector updates.

## Next Steps
- Run E2E again and review `client/e2e.log` for any remaining failures.
