# 2025-12-24-01-dod-refinement

## Summary
- Refined M004 S005–S013 specs to move concrete requirements into checkbox DoD lists.
- Reduced Notes to only add clarifying guidance; removed Notes where they duplicated DoD content.

## Work Completed
- Rewrote DoD sections for S005–S013 with specific, verifiable checklist items.
- Trimmed Notes to guidance-only content (kept minimal notes for S005; removed elsewhere when redundant).
