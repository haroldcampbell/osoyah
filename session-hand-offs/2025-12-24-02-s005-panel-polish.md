# 2025-12-24-02-s005-panel-polish

## Summary
- Polished S005 card density and side-panel behavior with auto-save, menu delete, and panel layout adjustments.
- Marked S005 complete in the M004 milestone checklist.
- Expanded mock data and aligned E2E tests with the new seeded lists and menu interactions.

## Work Completed
- Card surface shows markdown preview + metadata with relative time and tooltip.
- Side panel is fixed, full-height, wider, with internal scrolling and compact comment composer.
- Comment delete action moved into card menu; comment delete hover affordances refined.
- Board layout offsets via right margin when panel is open; selected card scrolls into view.
- Added mock lists/cards/comments; updated E2E tests for S005 and list workflows.

## Specs/Docs Updates
- `specs/M004-card-usability/S005-card-density-layout.md` updated to reflect panel behavior, auto-save, menu delete, and list offset.
- `docs/decisions.md` updated to prefer free SVG icons (Font Awesome).

## Tests
- `npm run lint` (client) passes.
- `npm run format:check` (client) passes.
- `npm run e2e` requires Playwright browsers (`npx playwright install`).

## Notes
- External E2E run passes per user.
- E2E logs live at `client/logs/e2e.log`; earlier failures were from new seed lists affecting list-count and duplicate title selectors.
- Panel offset uses right margin tied to `--card-panel-width` to preserve list spacing under the fixed panel.
- Delete icon uses a free Font Awesome SVG at `client/public/assets/icons/trash-can.svg` per decisions.
