# 2025-12-25-03-s006-01-polish

## Summary
- Extended S006-01 with card meta indicator changes, panel layout polish, and markdown styling adjustments.
- Moved markdown styles to global scope to apply to `innerHTML`.
- Replaced Font Awesome CSS dependency with a local free SVG icon.
- Expanded E2E coverage for markdown safety and layout behavior.

## Work Completed
- Removed card description previews and added details indicator icon with meta ordering (details, comments, last updated).
- Updated side panel: fixed width 800px, header divider, padding shifts, title styling, comment composer styling, and description edit height alignment.
- Adjusted markdown styles (global headings, code/blockquote fonts, image sizing rules).
- Added Font Awesome free SVG asset and removed fontawesome CSS import/dependency.
- Added E2E assertions for markdown safety, image sizing, and edit height constraints.
- Added base font family/size change and captured markdown stack decisions.

## Decisions
- Markdown rendering uses `marked` + `DOMPurify`.
- Global styles required for markdown injected via `innerHTML`.

## Open Questions
- None.
