# 2025-12-27-02-milestone-planning-mockups

## Summary
- Added new milestone/spec scaffolding for multi-board cards, relationships, hierarchy, roll-ups, and view/state work.
- Created Excalidraw mockups for hierarchy UI, account list view, and card parent/child panel; removed SVG versions.
- Milestone context: M005–M009 planning; M004 S006-02 completion noted.

## Work Completed
- Added M005–M009 milestone folders with initial spec drafts.
- Added Excalidraw mockups under `designs/mockups/` and updated the mockup index.
- Removed SVG mockups in favor of Excalidraw files.
- Updated `specs/milestone.md` to include M005–M009.
- Noted that S006-02 completion was manually recorded in specs.

## Decisions
- Use Excalidraw mockups as the editable format.

## Open Questions
- Confirm roll-up experiment variants and hierarchy UI details before implementation.

## Outstanding
- Run acceptance tests once implementation begins.

## Tests
- Not run (spec/mockup changes only).
