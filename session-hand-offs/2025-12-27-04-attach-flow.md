# 2025-12-27-04-s002-attach-flow

## Summary
- Implemented S002 add-existing-card flow in the card panel, with board/list selection and defaults.
- Added S002 E2E coverage and shared E2E helper for clicking cards.
- Stabilized markdown E2E interactions to avoid hangs.

## Work Completed
- Added attach UI, state handling, and service helpers for board membership.
- Updated and added E2E tests for global card identity and attach flows.
- Marked S002 DoD complete and updated milestone checklist.

## Decisions
- Default list for attach is the left-most list on the selected board.
- Disable attach when the card is already on the selected board.

## Notes
- User wants to experiment with a modal dialog for board/list selection before moving to S003.

## Tests
- User ran `npm run e2e` successfully; suite passes.
