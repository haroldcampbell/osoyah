# 2025-12-29-01-product-differentiation-specs

## Summary
- Captured differentiation candidates from v2 specs into the product differentiation notes.
- Drafted idea-stage differentiation milestones/specs with clear DoD, tests, and minimal dependencies.
- Added private business notes to `.gitignore`.

## Work Completed
- Updated `business/research/2025-12-29-01-product-differentiation.md` with differentiator candidates.
- Added `specs/Ideas/differentiation/` milestones and specs (structured workspaces, clarity/trust, smart defaults, actionable insight, context collaboration).
- Added foundation specs for org/workspace model, card ownership, and due dates.
- Simplified dependency sections to only call out non-obvious sequencing.

## Decisions
- Keep dependencies only where sequencing is non-obvious; remove broad blocks lists.

## Open Questions
- Confirm the desired folder naming (`specs/Ideas/differentiation`) and milestone IDs.

## Next Steps
- Review and refine any dependency assumptions in the new idea specs.
- Decide which differentiation milestone to prioritize for implementation.
