# M-future-003-Board Documents: Shared Notes

Conform to `docs/principles.md`.

## Summary
Plan a future milestone for board-linked notes/documents that can be referenced by cards across boards.

## Goal
Enable searchable, shared documents attached to boards with standard CRUD flows.

## Scope
In-scope:
- Create, edit, and delete board documents.
- Link documents to boards (not cards) and allow cards to reference them.
- Search and browse documents within a board.
Out-of-scope:
- Real-time collaboration or interactive documents.
- Global (cross-board) document storage.
- Backend persistence or multi-user collaboration.

## Specs
- TBD

## Notes
- Ensure document links are stable even as cards move between boards.
