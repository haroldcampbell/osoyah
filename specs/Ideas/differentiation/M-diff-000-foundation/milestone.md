# M-diff-000-Foundation: Differentiator Foundations

Conform to `docs/principles.md`.

## Summary
Establish baseline data models needed by differentiation features (org/workspace structure, card ownership, and due dates).

## Goal
Provide minimal, explicit foundations so differentiation specs can rely on consistent data contracts.

## Scope
In-scope:
- Organization and Workspace data model primitives.
- Card ownership field and assignment rules.
- Card due date field and validation rules.

Out-of-scope:
- Billing systems or payment flows.
- Automation or workflow engines.

## Specs
- [ ] S001-Organization + Workspace Model
- [ ] S002-Card Ownership Model
- [ ] S003-Card Due Dates
