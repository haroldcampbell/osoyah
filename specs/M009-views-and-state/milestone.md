# M009-Views and State: Pipelines + Completion

Conform to `docs/principles.md`.

## Summary
Add card state/completion rules and introduce list view for account-style boards.

## Goal
Support pipeline boards where lists are stages while enabling account list views with side-panel details.

## Scope
In-scope:
- Card state and completion behavior.
- Configurable mapping of completion to a Done list.
- Board view modes (card vs list).
Out-of-scope:
- Full-screen account detail view.
- Pipeline-specific automation.
