# Milestones

## Notes

-   All milestones and specs must conform to `docs/principles.md`.
-   Milestone docs live at `specs/M00X-*/milestone.md`. Future milestone docs live under `specs/Ideas/`. Specs use `S00X-` prefixes and live alongside the milestone doc.
-   Templates follow the `_template_<purpose>.md` naming convention.
